# Solarian Scale

## How the Scale Works

Using the concept of Emergent Harmonics (EH), this scale was built using the harmonics of the planets in our solar system as a hypothetical EH outcome.

Each note in the scale represents the planets, with the primary root note being represented by the sun. To determine the frequency of each "note", the fundamental frequency for each planet was determined by multiplying a base frequency (160.2 Hz) by the ratio of the planet's orbital period to that of the sun.

All ratios are in comparison to our point of view on earth.

The frequency of an orbit can be calculated using the formula:

f = 1 / T

where f is the frequency and T is the orbital period.

The orbital period of Earth around the Sun is approximately 365.25 days or 31,557,600 seconds.

Therefore, the frequency of the Earth's orbit is:

f = 1 / 31,557,600 seconds â‰ˆ 3.16875344 x 10^-8 Hz

To find the solarian scale value for Earth, we divide the fundamental frequency of the sun (160.2 Hz) by the frequency of Earth's orbit:

319.68 = 160.2 Hz / (3.16875344 x 10^-8 Hz)

### Coscmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) as the Root Note

One frequency that is often cited as being ubiquitous in the universe is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) frequency, which has a wavelength of approximately 1.9 mm and a frequency of 160.2 GHz. This radiation is believed to be a remnant of the early universe, and it is present everywhere in the universe, with a nearly uniform temperature of about 2.73 Kelvin.

Using CMBR as the primary root sun frequency and multiplying that by the planetary orbital ratio, we get the values for each note in the scale.

### Octaves and Harmonics

The frequency of Earth in the Solarian scale is close to double the frequency of the Sun. This can be a little confusing when it comes to the concept of octaves because in Western music, octaves represent a doubling of frequency.

In the Solarian scale, each planet is a unique note in the scale, and there is no doubling of frequency to create higher or lower versions of each note. However, the frequency ratios between each planet can be used to create harmonics and overtones that create the perception of higher or lower versions of the same notes. So, while the Solarian scale doesn't have octaves in the traditional sense, it still allows for the creation of a wide range of pitches and tones through the use of harmonics and overtones.

## How the Solarian Scale compares to Western Music

The Solarian scale and the Western scale have different structures and tunings. The Solarian scale is based on the orbits of planets in our solar system, while the Western scale is based on the 12-tone equal temperament tuning system.

The Solarian scale has different intervals between each note compared to the Western scale. For example, in the Western scale, the interval between adjacent notes is a half step, which corresponds to a frequency ratio of approximately 1.059:1. In the Solarian scale, the intervals between notes are based on the frequency ratios of the planets' orbits, which are not evenly spaced.

Therefore, the Solarian scale has a unique and distinct sound compared to the Western scale. It also has a different set of harmonies and chords that can be used to create music.
