# Schumann Resonance

The most common frequency found on Earth is difficult to determine as it can depend on various factors such as location, time, and activity. However, some studies suggest that the most prevalent frequency on Earth is around 10 Hz, which is in the alpha range of human brainwaves and is associated with relaxation and creativity. This frequency is also sometimes referred to as the Schumann Resonance, which is the resonant frequency of the Earth's atmosphere-ionosphere cavity.

The Schumann resonance and its harmonics are a series of frequencies with an infinite number of harmonics, although the higher harmonics are generally weaker in amplitude. The first five harmonics are typically the most relevant and are often studied in relation to the Schumann resonance. The exact values of these frequencies can vary slightly depending on factors such as atmospheric conditions, but 7.83 Hz is considered the fundamental resonance frequency.
